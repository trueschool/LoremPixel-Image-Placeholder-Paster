#LoremPixel.com Image Placeholder URL Paster

This Alfred Workflow simply pastes the basic URL “http://lorempixel.com” into your frontmost application. You can append image dimensions into the URL to easily create a placeholder image for your web designs. 

Example syntax: 
http://lorempixel.com/800/200

This creates a random picture 800px wide and 200px tall. There are many modifiers you can make to the URL to control the color, size, and subject matter of the images placed. 

See http://lorempixel.com for more details.
